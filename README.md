# Task_1-UI-UX-Enhancement
This repository contains an improved version of the FOSSEE Workshop Booking System as part of the Python UI/UX Screening Task 1.

While exploring the provided version of the repository—which was primarily Django-focused—I cloned and ran it locally to get a better understanding of the existing structure. During this process, I felt that the UI/UX elements were a bit overshadowed due to the tight coupling with backend logic.
To better showcase the user interface and experience aspects, I’ve committed a standalone version focusing specifically on UI/UX. That being said, the structure has been kept flexible and can be smoothly integrated into the original Django workflow without disrupting the existing system.
